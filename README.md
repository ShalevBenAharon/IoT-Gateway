<p>The Generic IoT Infrastructure Project is a scalable and flexible solution designed to manage IoT devices, store their data, and analyze it in a fast and easy way. 
This project was developed as part of my Java studies and incorporates various design patterns such as Factory, Singleton, Object Pool, and Observer,
  while adhering to SOLID and OOP principles.
  The infrastructure consists of multiple modules, each developed independently and integrated together to form a cohesive system. These modules were 
  built using modular development practices and can be extended or replaced with custom implementations to meet specific requirements.</p>
